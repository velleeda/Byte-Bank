# Byte Bank

Project created in one of Alura's React courses to learn about test automation in front-end applications. <br />

In it I learned: <br />

- How to guarantee the functionality of the application through automated tests;
- How to make descriptive and consistent tests;
- What needs to be tested and what doesn't.
